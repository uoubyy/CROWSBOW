Endless Graves is a 3D Dungeon Adventure game where Twitch chat can provide aid or attempt to thwart the player in real time. Use your sword and crossbow to defeat the hordes sent by Twitch chat. Use the commands: (!ranged, !melee, !skel, !drag, and !heal) to directly impact the experience and become an integral part of the play.
